Some of the data and code for the manuscript "Environmental correlates of canopy gap locations and sizes in an Andean tropical montane forest"
This repository contains the code used in the extreme gradient boosting modelling of gap size correlates.
It also contains the datasets: gaps.large (the large gaps described in the paper) and gaps.small.zip (small gaps). 
Data in the small gaps file have been rounded to 2-3 decimal places to compress the file size. 
To receive the original, non-rounded dataset, you may contact the corresponding author. 
Data headers are descriptive and should be easily interpretable from the manuscript.
